  <p>Welcome to my first article. A Layover with Purpose

I have been asked many times what the best thing is about being an airline pilot. I usually get tongue tied when answering the question, because there is not one best thing about being an airline pilot, but too many to mention in one quick response.

There are times, however, when we live through an experience that encapsulates why being a pilot can be such an extraordinary experience. This year, I got to live through one of those beautiful experiences that make me very grateful for the career path I chose, and I felt it would be worth to share it. 

A few months ago, while returning from a family vacation, I was captivated by a documentary shown on our United flight from Tokyo. The film, All That Breathes, tells the remarkable story of two brothers in Delhi, India, who dedicate their lives to rescuing injured wild birds of prey, particularly the black kite.

What I didn’t anticipate was that I would soon meet these very brothers in person.

Growing up in the mountains of Central Argentina, I discovered the thrill of flight early on. As a teenager, I learned to fly hang gliders, a passion that profoundly shaped my life. Flying kept me grounded during an age when many teens easily lose their way. More importantly, it deepened my connection to nature and instilled a lasting reverence for the environment. But it was soaring alongside birds that truly ignited a lifelong passion for flight.

This passion eventually led me to the United States, where I pursued a career in aviation. It was no accident that I chose United Airlines—many of its pilot bases are near mountains, where I could continue nurturing my love for both flying and the natural world. My wife, also from Argentina, and I settled near Denver, Colorado, a place that closely resembles the mountains of my youth.

Living in Colorado brought me closer to nature in unexpected ways. One morning, my wife and I witnessed a group of kids injure a bird in the open space behind our home. Rushing to the scene, I discovered a large grey owl had been hurt. Saddened by the situation, I persuaded the kids to help me rescue it. I contacted the Colorado Wildlife Foundation, who directed me to The Birds of Prey Foundation. That afternoon, I navigated Denver’s rush hour traffic with an injured owl in a box on my back seat. The foundation took the bird in, and over five months, they nursed it back to health and trained it to fly again. When the bird was ready, they invited me to release it back into the wild—a moment that deeply connected me with the creatures that had inspired my passion for flying.



As I watched All That Breathes on that flight, I was struck by the brothers’ dedication to saving wild birds. Their passion resonated with my own life’s journey.  I had been flying for United Airlines for over 28 years, most recently as a Boeing 787 Dreamliner pilot on the Newark to New Delhi route. In an extraordinary twist of fate, my next scheduled flight was to New Delhi.



Moved by the documentary, I reached out to the Wildlife Rescue Foundation in Delhi. I contacted Nadeem and his brother, Saud, the film’s protagonists, to see if they would welcome a visit. Just five days after watching them care for birds on screen, I was watching them do it in person. They gave me a tour of their facility, a place they’ve devoted their lives to building, and shared their journey with the foundation.




Meeting them, I felt a deep emotional connection—not only to the birds that have guided my own life but to these two brothers who share my passion for nature and flight. In that moment, I was overwhelmed with gratitude—for the fortune of flying around the world and meeting such inspiring people, and for the incredible journey that brought me to United Airlines, a company that has allowed me to pursue my dreams both in the skies and on the ground.




While, getting to know Nadeem and Saud, they expressed that their dream had been to be able to fly as well. After the visit, I wished that one day perhaps, I could give them such chance by taking them up for a glider ride.
Such chance presented itself this past October when Nadeem came to the US to travel the country conducting screenings for the documentary. 
In one of those rare fateful moments, Nadeem happened to be in the New York area for a few days which coincided with a block of days off that I had. When I picked him up near Putnam Valley, NY, where Nadeem was staying, the day looked grey and drizzly, and he thought that our adventure would be cancelled. As fate would have it, just an hour to the West, the day was beautiful and sunny with forecast for some lift to stay aloft using thermals

.

To be able to take Nadeem up to fly like the bird he heals was an experience of a lifetime. One of those moments Argentine poet Horacio Ferrer calls “eternal moments.” Which he defined them as those you carry with you until your last breath.
It is experiences like these that make our career as pilots incredibly rewarding and worth all the sacrifices to get to be one.
